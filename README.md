## 📌 Overview

**VibeLink** is an AI-powered, college-exclusive communication platform built for **MNNIT students**, designed to centralize campus interaction through **verified institutional access**.

Instead of scattering communication across WhatsApp groups, emails, and unrelated apps, VibeLink brings **chat, announcements, posts, video calling, and community interaction** into a single, secure, college-only platform — verified using college email IDs, with AI keeping the space safe and spam-free.

---

## 🧠 Problem It Solves

In most colleges, communication is scattered across WhatsApp groups, notices, emails, and different platforms — leading to:

- Missed announcements
- Too many unrelated/unverified groups
- No way to confirm members actually belong to the college
- Toxic or spam content going unmoderated
- No central place for posts, clubs, events, and real-time interaction

**VibeLink solves this with one verified, AI-moderated platform built specifically for the college ecosystem.**

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **OTP-Based Authentication** — Signup/login verified via **college email IDs only**, ensuring a trusted, student-only community
- 👤 **Student Profiles** — Each user has a profile linked to their verified college identity
- 📢 **Announcements & Posts** — Share updates, notices, and posts within the campus community
- 💬 **Real-Time Messaging** — 1:1 and group chat powered by **Socket.IO**
- 📞 **Video Calling** — Integrated real-time video calling via **ZegoCloud**
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Content Moderation** — LLM-based moderation (**Groq API / Llama 3.3**) automatically detects and hides toxic or inappropriate content
- 👥 **Friend Requests & Social Interactions** — Connect with peers across the campus
- 🔔 **Real-Time Notifications** — Stay updated instantly on activity that matters
- 📱 **Responsive UI** — Works smoothly across desktop and mobile

## 🏗️ System Design (High Level)

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture:

- **Frontend** handles UI, routing, state, and real-time client-side interactions
- **Backend** manages REST APIs, authentication, database operations, and business logic
- **MongoDB** stores user data, chats, posts, announcements, and friend/social graphs
- **Socket.IO** powers real-time messaging and live notifications
- **ZegoCloud** enables real-time, scalable video calling between users
- **Groq API (Llama 3.3)** performs real-time AI content moderation on posts and messages
- **Nodemailer** handles OTP delivery for college-email verification during signup
